					Hello! My name is Khalid Lipscomb I am a new developer in this wide world of coding. I have has been coding since February 2017 and my knowledge has grown every day, I have experience coding by working in groups and solo. When creating a website I am happy to follow instructions to create a website, but I am also more than comfortable flexing my creative muscles to make a completely original template.

					Before coding I attended UNC Charlotte graduating in 2009 with a B.S. in Psychology. Afterwards I spent several years trying to find a career that I was passionate about. Late 2016 I found my way into coding through some friends. I happened to find the UNC Charlotte bootcamp while studying coding on my own. The six month bootcamp was intense but left me prepared for the professional world of coding.
